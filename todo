TODO

- copy ViewStmt in gram.y as MatViewStmt
- Store materialized view as table
- Prevent listing materialized view when enumerating tables of a database
- PG_PARSE_QUERY in postgres.c calls raw_parser in parser.c
- make matview.c analogous to view.c
- include defintions of functions to be used in utility.c (define matview etc.)
- CreateCommandTag constructs the command (commandTag object)
- main processing fuction is execSimpleQuery
    - uses pg_parse_query for parsing the query string (produces parsetree_list)
    - CreateCommandTag uses parsetree_list
- add CREATE MATVIEW to help file


- drop MV
- implemet \dm
- listing views should not list mv
- edit definematerializedvirtualrelation
-in function addnewrelationtuple in heap.c (add entry to pg_class )...need to specify that matview has space while view does not


- changing pg_class.h requires make clean and make
- utility.c : 530,
- view.c: 263
- postgres.c : 574
 - analyze.c:84
